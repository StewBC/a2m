The utils folder holds the implementation for a library that shared by all apps and libraries in this project.  It is mainly an implementation of a dynamic array class used everywhere, and a wrapper for FILE, some shared string functions and some loggers.
The opcode info (text, lengths, params and how to display opcodes) also lives here.
